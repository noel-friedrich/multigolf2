                Welcome to Multigolf 2! Here you can play Minigolf games
                across a board made up of multiple phones! To play,
                you'll need at least 2 (the more the better!) phones.
                You won't need to install anything anywhere, this all just
                runs in your browser! After starting the game, everyone will
                have to simply scan a QR code and start designing the
                perfect multigolf course! 
            </p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                When you start the game, your phone will become the host.
                All phones will connect to your phone by scanning a QR
                code. From then, you will be asked to construct a minigolf
                course by physically arranging your phones. Naturally,
                you'll also be able to spice your course up with fun
                obstacles to make increase the difficulty (and fun).
                And then you'll play! You'll take turns golfing your
                balls into the hole while this phone will serve as
                an info screen to keep track of scores and will 
                enable you to configure things. Once round 1 is finished,
                the next player will be asked to build their course,
                such that at the end, every player will have been the
                course constructor once. Finally, a winner will be chosen
                and deemed king/queen of Multigolf. Doesn't that sound
                just a little fun?
            </p>
            <h2>Okay, but how does it work technologically?</h2>
            <p>
                Well. Thanks for asking! When you start the game,
                this phone will create a QR code with which others
                will join and form connections via WebRTC. From then on,
                the host will manage the Multigolf game, deciding which
                ball flies where in which second. Participating phones
                send updates to the host phone which will react accordingly 
                and potentially send updates to all connected clients,
                connecting the phones and making balls fly through
                phone screens seemlessly. Of course, theres a custom
                physics engine distributed on all phones that makes
                sure that everything happens smoothly. And at the end,
                balls just phase from phone screen to screen without
                much lag. It's kinda satisfying to watch. You
                should try it.
