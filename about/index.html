            <h1>About Multigolf</h1>
            <p>
                Multigolf is a fun and unique tabletop game that doesn't require any
                preparation, sets or extra materials. By using the participants phones
                as the game table, people are forced to focus and able to build a
                tangible course that intuitively makes sense. Participants don't
                just play a minigolf game on some connected phones; they also construct
                their own levels in real life. 
            </p>
            <h2>How the Game works</h2>
            <p>
                Every Multigolf game starts with connecting phones to the host device,
                which is simply the first device to start a game, which the others can
                join. Then a course is built using the phones in real life, connecting
                them by drawing lines between them and thus creating a fun and exciting
                minigolf course that may contain obstacles and other fun features.
                Afterwards, depending on the chosen game-mode, you will be able to
                shoot balls between phones into holes! The phones are connected wirelessly
                and provide a seamless interface that crosses phone borders and creates a
                fun and satisfying look and experience!
            </p>
            <h2>Development and Hosting</h2>
            <p>
                Multigolf started as a Hackathon project. However, it's now rebuilt and
                developed by me, Noel Friedrich! The game itself doesn't require much
                compute power – there is no central golfing server where games are hosted:
                everything revolves around the host device which connects directly to the
                players phones via mostly peer-to-peer connections. This enables fast
                communication between devices (which is important for satisfying screen-to-screen balls)
                and reduces the cost of running this site dramatically!
            </p>
            <h2>Status and Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                Multigolf is constantly receiving updates and fixes. It's still in an early
                stage of development but already fully functional. I’m always open to
                feedback and ideas that could improve the gameplay or website. Feel free
                to use the contact form and don’t hesitate to ask any questions! I appreciate
                any help and feedback that I can get.
            </p>
