                    new session of Multigolf! Gather your friends,

                    running or being configured. While other
                    phones may be reconnected, this phone (the host)
                    cannot. Closing this page will lose
                    the entire game state; you will have to 
                    restart from Scratch.

                <h2>Choose your Gamemode</h2>
                <p>
                    To start, choose a Gamemode. The number of players
                    does not have to match the number of phones. You can
                    play a Tournament with only one more phone
                    (maybe not a very interesting one). You can only
                    choose one mode, which cannot be changed without
                    restarting the game.
                </p>
                <h3>üèÜ Tournament (1-8 Players)</h3>
                <p>
                    Introducing Tournament mode - the ultimate party-friendly
                    showdown! In this classic mode, each player takes turns
                    crafting a course for all to play. The game tracks scores
                    across all boards, culminating in the crowning of the
                    Multigolf Queen! Will you rise to the challenge and
                    claim the title?
                </p>
                <button onclick="chooseGamemode(gameMode.Tournament)">

                <h3>üî´ Duell (2 Players)</h3>
                <p>
                    In Duell mode, both players collaborate
                    to build a course and place their opponent's hole. Using
                    the same ball, players take turns hitting it in their
                    chosen direction, aiming to reach their opponent's hole.
                    It's a game of skill and strategy where each shot counts,
                    and the player who sinks their opponent's hole first claims
                    victory. Are you ready to tee off against your friend using
                    the same ball?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: red">Warning!</span>
                    This mode is best with more phones, as courses get
                    much more insteresting. With only one other phone,
                    the game will likely end in a single hit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last but <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">not</span>
                    least: Sandbox mode. This mode isn't as competitive and great
                    for testing the concept or really anything you like. Spawn
                    as many balls as you want and let the chaos arrive.
                    There is no player limit, as there are no scores that
                    are tracked automatically.

                    Welcome to the device connection centre! You're the host, so you're
                    responsible for managing this process. Every player
                    will have to scan a different QR code that will be
                    generated on this phone. Make sure that every QR code
                    is scanned only once by one device!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The devices will try to connect directly via a peer-to-peer
                    connection, similar to how videocalls work. Your game data isn't
                    sent to any server.

                <p>

                    experience connection problems between devices that are in different
                    networks. For best results, connect all devices to a local hotspot,
