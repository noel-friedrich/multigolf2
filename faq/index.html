                    <div class="answer">
                        <b>No</b>. The host phone display's useful information
                        for the game like status, scores and who's turn it is 
                        and cannot participate as a device in the Multigolf course.
                        Thus, when you're playing with 5 phones, only 4 can be used
                        for the course itself while one must play host.

                    <div class="answer">
                        <b>Yes</b>! You may use any device with a touch screen
                        for the course. The host device does not need to have a touch
                        screen: it makes sense to use a laptop or computer as the 
                        host to increase the number of phones to build the course.

                    <div class="question">How many devices to I need to play?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        A good Multigolf course is made up of at least 3 devices plus 
                        a host device. You can start games with only two devices
                        (one host, one course), but that won't be much fun.

                <div class="entry">
                    <div class="question">Is there a maximum number of devices?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <b>No</b>. You can theoretically add hundreds of phones, although
                        the rounds might take a while to setup and play. The ideal number of
                        devices might be ~6, since a course that is too big get's boring,
                        especially if you're just waiting for others to finish a round.

                <div class="entry">
                    <div class="question">How do the phones know where they are?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        While constructing a course, you will be prompted to connect
                        the phones by drawing a line with your finger along the edges that
                        connect phones together. The host device then does some math and
                        figures out how the course looks!

                </div>
                <div class="entry">
                    <div class="question">Why can't I build a circular course?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        Most phones have much smaller display's than physical sizes
                        (they have bezels around the display). However, the game does 
                        not know how large these are. Thus, the shape of the digital course
                        doesn't match the actual physical model of the course,
                        it only approximates it. This makes it nearly impossible to 
                        align devices to both form a circular path digitally and physically.

                <div class="entry">
                    <div class="question">What happens when a device disconnects ingame?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        If the host device fails, the game stops. Try to keep it alive!
                        If a device is a part of the course and disconnects, you can simply
                        reconnect it mid-game. If it fails permanently (battery dead?),
                        you'll have to restart the game.
