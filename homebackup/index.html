            <p>
                Multigolf is a cross-device Minigolf game. Build courses out of 
                multiple phones, then battle your friends in the available
                gamemodes. Grab your friends, steal their phones and begin
                building complex minigolf courses on any tabletop anywhere. 
                It's extremely simple to setup and doesn't require any
                download, everyone will simply scan a QR code and begin playing.
                Sounds good? Then try it out!
            </p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                By creating a game, your device will become the server. This server
                will not be able to show the course, but will rather function as a
                control center and will show you what to do. After configuring
                the game (choosing gamemode, entering names of
                everybody...) you'll begin designing your course! You'll have
                to tell the phones how they are arranged physically by drawing
                lines along the connected edges. Once set up, the game is afoot!
                Some gamemodes require multiple people to design their own
                unique courses, so make sure to be creative with your course 
                design!
